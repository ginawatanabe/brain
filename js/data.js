  name: 'Cerebrum',
  description: 'Higher level functions.',
  detail: 'The cerebrum is a large folded mass of nervous tissue that makes up 85% \
  of the brain\'s weight. It is associated with thought and understanding. Each cerebral hemisphere is subdivided into the frontal \
  lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe.',

  The medulla holds all neurons connecting the brain to the spinal cord. The pons \
  holds all neurons connecting the higher regions of the brain to the medulla and spinal cord. \
  The midbrain is essential to motor system control, vision, hearing, and reflexes.',
